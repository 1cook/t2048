# t2048
2048 game for the TI-89 graphing calculator.
# Compilation
You need tigcc to compile this. Enter this command:
```bash
tigcc -Os t2048.c
```
You will then get the file t2048.89z, which is the compiled binary.
#Installation
You can install this on your calculator using tilp or ti-graphlink.
Transfer the binary to your calculator's main folder.
If you have a TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium, you should use "t2048.89z".
If you have a TI-92 or TI-92 plus, you should use "t2048.9xz".
If you have a Voyage 200, you should use "t2048.v2z".
# Running
While on the home screen, type the following into your calculator.
```
t2048()
```
This name was chosen so that you do not have to use the alpha, 2nd or, diamond keys.
# Compatibility
This is compatibile with the TI-89 series of calculators.
This will also run on the TI-92 Series and Voyage 200, however, the game will also not fill up the entire screen.
(There used to be problems with the arrow keys on the 92 series and v200. Those have been fixed and arrows will work properly so long as you are using the correct binary.)
